![Generated password using all four criteria](/Assets/generated-screen.PNG)

With this assignment, I wrote code in JavaScript to randomly generate a password from a number of chosen criteria, including the length of the password and whether to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. With it, the user can click on the "Generate Password" button on the page to be asked what their criteria are for the final result. They're first asked how long it should be, then are given four confirmation popups for which characters they'd like to include. After they've made their selections, they are given a randomly generated string of characters they can use as a password that matches all of the chosen criteria. If they enter an invalid number for the length of the password or fail to select any of the criteria, they will be given an error message and instructed to try again.

In doing this assignment, I learned how to look out for and handle edge cases. For instance, if the password generated happened to not use at least one character of a chosen category, even if that character technically was available to be randomly selected, it would fail to meet the requirements given by the user, and the password would not have been useable in that instance. To address that possibility, I made the code add a random character of a given category to the final result as soon as the category is selected, then accounted for the extra characters by modifying the loop later on that picks randomly from every chosen category. That way, if the user picks every category for their password, even if one of those categories does not have a character from it chosen for the end result, the end result will at least have the character that was added initially. I also got practice using while loops effectively when receiving user input in order to handle invalid inputs to prevent errors.
